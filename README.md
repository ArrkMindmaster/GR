# GRate
Homework project for interview preparation

Notes, and additional assumptions:
*   No header row for each file. If it exists, it will be ignored.
*   Field names must be specified exactly, and in the correct order, because a header need not be specified.
*   All lines are terminated with a carriage return.
*   Duplicates, even in the same file, are OK, though the email address could be used to differentiate specific entries
*   Any dates which cannot be interpreted as a date indicate an invalid record, and the whole record will be skipped.
*   File differentiation is unnecessary: a different delimiter can be used on each line, as long as it is consistent in that line.
*   Adding a blank line between each sort, for differentiation
*   Any number of arguments can be added, more than 0.
